# Transliteration
Transliteration is the process of converting text from one script to another script, while keeping the phonetic meaning of the words intact. In the context of machine learning, transliteration is a task where given a word in one script, the goal is to predict its pronunciation in another script.

In this project English is transliterated to Hindi
